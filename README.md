# C Programming Course Code

This repository contains all of my C programming code from the course I am currently taking. It includes solutions to assignments, exercises, and projects that cover a wide range of C programming topics. Each file or folder is organized by the topic it corresponds to.

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of my work and progress in learning C programming. It includes basic concepts such as loops, arrays, pointers, and more advanced topics like structures, dynamic memory allocation, and file handling. The goal is to document my learning journey and share the code with others for review and collaboration.
